***********************************************
The experiment contains a series of robotic movement scaled in the order of 1 to 10 
with Action 1 being the first motion and Action 10 being the last.

The file is indicated as AC_x_1 to AC_x_50 where x=1 to 10 is the scaled robot movement.
Each action contains 50 trials with 10 seconds recording. There may be a small variation 
in data recording.

Each excell sheet contains Timestamp, Sensor id , Value 0, Value 1 and Value 2 where 
Sensor Id 1 refers to accelerometer
Sensor id 2 refers to Gyroscope
Sensor id 3 refers to Mangetometer
Value 0 refers to X-axis 
Value 1 refers to Y-axis
Value 2 refers to Z-axis
